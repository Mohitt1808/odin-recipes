    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Gulab jamun is a popular Indian dessert consisting of fried dough balls soaked in a sweet, sticky sugar syrup, often flavored with rose water and cardamom. The name translates to "rose berry," reflecting the rose-scented syrup. It's a milk-solid based sweet, traditionally made with khoya (reduced milk solids), and is known for its soft, spongy texture and rich, sweet flavor. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>½ cup instant dry milk powder (such as Carnation®)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter (such as Land O'Lakes®)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, sugar, cardamom, rose water, and saffron in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until consistency is syrupy, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix milk powder, flour, and baking soda in a bowl until well-combined. Slowly mix in butter and yogurt until dough comes together. Let gulab dough rest for 5 minutes. Shape into smooth balls the size of pennies.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Test the temperature of the oil by dropping in a small piece of dough. When it sits at the bottom of the pan for 1 minute before coming to the surface, the oil is ready.</li>
        <li>Fry 4 gulab balls at a time, stirring carefully, until dark golden brown on all sides, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper-towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining gulab.</li>
        <li>Bring syrup back up to a boil and drop in fried gulab. Remove from heat and let them soak in the syrup, covered, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><solid>Cook's Note:</solid></h3>
    <p>Try adding ice cream to these hot waffle balls, you'll be delighted!</p>
    <p>The longer you leave the waffle balls in the syrup the better it is going to be; some people leave the waffle balls overnight.</p>
