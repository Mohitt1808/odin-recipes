        <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
        <p>Easy vegeterian spinach lasagna is satisfying layers of stretchy melted mozzarella, creamy ricotta, and spinach combine with sauce-coated lasagna noodles for the ultimate comfort food.</p>
    <h2><strong>Step:1</strong></h2>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish with cooking spray. Set aside.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>step:2</strong></h2>
    <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place spinach in the water and boil until wilted and tender, about 2 minutes. Remove spinach with a slotted spoon, pressing out excess water. Set aside.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Step:3</strong></h2>
    <p>Cook lasagna in the same boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Step:4</strong></h2>
    <p>Mix spinach, ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, egg, nutmeg, basil, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until well combined.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Step:5</strong></h2>
    <p>Spread 1/4 cup pasta sauce on the bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Top with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the ricotta-egg mixture, and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. Repeat layers of 3 more noodles, 1/2 cup ricotta-egg mixture, and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. End with remaining 3 noodles and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese. Top with Parmesan cheese. Cover casserole with aluminum foil.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Step:6</strong></h2>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Uncover casserole and continue baking until lasagna is bubbling and lightly browned, about 25 more minutes. Let lasagna stand 5 minutes before serving.</p>
